# Portfolio

As a means to stay updated with the latest technologies and also provide a platform to highlight my skills and experiences, this project allowed me to showcase my ability to design and structure information.

Design was inspired on a portfolio's website generated by open source website builder [Wowchemy](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes).


## Use as your own

Feel free to use this portfolio as your own, just let me know if you do and/or if you need any help to.

To use it, all you need to do is:
- Update userData.ts file with your information.
- Update/remove data from public folder (CV file, imgs and favicon).
